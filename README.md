Visual breakdown of booking status: success, cancellations (by driver/customer), and no driver found

Ride volume trends over time with dynamic line chart

Total booking value and volume summary

Sidebar navigation for quick filtering by vehicle type, revenue, cancellation, and ratings

Visually appealing dark-yellow theme to match ride-hailing brand aesthetics

Page-wise drilldown navigation for focused analysis

# Key Insights
Identified booking success and failure patterns across various cancellation reasons

Uncovered ride volume fluctuations based on date filters to understand peak demand days
